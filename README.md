## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9+ for Next.js 16; use a current LTS release with pnpm 11
- pnpm 11.20.0

### Installation

1. **Open this project folder in a terminal.**

2. **Install dependencies** using the pinned pnpm version:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

    Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure only the services you plan to use. See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for details.

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see the magic ✨

## Code checks

Run these before opening a pull request:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
```

Next.js 16 no longer runs lint during builds. The ESLint CLI uses `eslint.config.mjs`. New React Compiler diagnostics for refs, immutability, effect state updates, and manual memoization report warnings while existing animation and realtime components are migrated. Hook ordering violations remain errors.

Blog frontmatter requires a title, summary, and `publishedAt` date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Optional fields are `image`, `author`, and a list of `tags`. Invalid frontmatter raises a content error; unknown blog slugs return a 404.

Files under `public/assets` can be replaced at the same URL and cache for one hour before revalidation. Next.js content-hashed static assets retain immutable caching.

## 🎨 Make It Your Own

Personal details live in [`src/data/config.ts`](src/data/config.ts), skills and experience in [`src/data/constants.ts`](src/data/constants.ts), and project cards in [`src/data/projects.tsx`](src/data/projects.tsx).

The portfolio domain is intentionally unset until you configure your own domain. Without one, canonical URLs and the sitemap host are omitted.

---

## ⌨️ Customize the 3D keyboard

Apply keyboard colors and icons in `SKILLS` in [`src/data/constants.ts`](src/data/constants.ts):

- `keyboardColor`: keycap color, such as `"#ff9408"`.
- `keyboardIcon`: copy an SVG URL from [thesvg.org](https://thesvg.org) and paste it here. You can also use a local file under `public/assets/keyboard/logos/`.
- `label` and `shortDescription`: text shown when interacting with a key.
- `shortcut`: optional physical key code, such as `"KeyQ"`. Keep shortcuts unique; defaults follow QWERTY letter order.

The demo accepts logo names too, but `keyboardIcon` needs an image URL or local asset path. Without keyboard overrides, keys use the skill's `color` and `icon`.

Keys follow the order of `SKILLS`. To change the default six columns, pass a second argument to `createKeyboardScene` in [`keyboard-scene.tsx`](src/components/keyboard/keyboard-scene.tsx). Rows adjust automatically to the skill count.

## 🔌 Realtime Features (Optional)

The portfolio supports optional realtime features powered by a **separate backend API**:

- 🖱️ **Live cursors** — See other visitors' cursors in realtime
- 👥 **Online presence** — Shows who's currently on the site
- 💬 **Chat** — Live chat between visitors

These features activate automatically when the `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` environment variable is set. Without it, the portfolio works perfectly fine as a static site — no realtime features, no backend dependency.
